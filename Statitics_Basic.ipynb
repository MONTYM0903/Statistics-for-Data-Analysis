        "Answer 1: Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. In statistics, two important approaches are descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Though both are connected, they serve different purposes. In this essay, I will explain their differences in detail with examples and diagrams.\n",
        "**Descriptive Statistics**\n",
        "Descriptive statistics is used to summarize, organize, and represent data in a meaningful way. It focuses only on the data that has been collected and does not go beyond it. The main goal is to make raw data understandable.\n",
        "Examples of descriptive statistics include:\n",
        "Calculating average marks of students in a class.\n",
        "Finding the highest and lowest temperature recorded in a city during a week.\n",
        "Representing survey results in the form of graphs and charts.\n",

        "Graphs and Charts: Pie charts, bar graphs, histograms.\n",
        "**Example of Descriptive Statistics**\n",
        "Suppose marks of 5 students are [60, 70, 80, 75, 65]. We can say:\n",
        "Mean = (60+70+80+75+65)/5 = 70\n",

        "                      This gives us a quick description of their performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inferential Statistics**\n",
        "Inferential statistics goes beyond the data we have. It uses data from a sample to make conclusions or predictions about the entire population. Since studying an entire population is often costly or impossible, inferential statistics helps us generalize from a small group.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Examples of Inferential statistics include:**\n",
        "Predicting election results based on a survey of 1000 voters.\n",

        "**Methods of Inferential Statistics:**\n",
        "Estimation: Predicting population mean or proportion.\n",
        "Hypothesis Testing: Testing assumptions about populations.\n",
        "Regression and Correlation: Studying relationships between variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example of Inferential Statistics**\n",
        "If we test 10 bulbs from a factory and find the average lifetime = 1000 hours,\n",
        "we can infer that the entire production batch has a lifetime of about 1000 hours.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusions :-**\n",
        "In short, descriptive statistics answers “What does the data show?” while inferential statistics answers “What can we predict from the data?”. Both are equally important because descriptive statistics helps us understand data clearly, and inferential statistics allows us to apply that understanding to make decisions about larger groups.\n"

        "Answer: In **statistics**, sampling is the process of selecting a smaller group (sample) from a larger group (population) for the purpose of analysis. Studying an entire population is often impossible due to cost, time, or accessibility, so sampling provides a practical way of drawing conclusions.\n",

        "Example: Suppose there are 100 students in a college. We want to select 10 students. If we assign each student a number and pick numbers randomly (like a lottery), that is random sampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        "Easy to understand.\n",
        "Reduces bias.\n",

        "\n",
        "In stratified sampling, the population is divided into smaller groups (strata) based on characteristics like age, gender, or income. Then, samples are taken from each group proportionally.\n",
        "Example: In a class with 30 boys and 20 girls, if we need 10 students, we select 6 boys and 4 girls to represent both groups fairly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "Ensures representation of all subgroups.\n",
        "More accurate results.\n",

        "Disadvantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "Requires prior knowledge of groups.\n",
        "Slightly more complex to organize.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion**\n",
        "\n",
        "Sampling is a very important tool in statistics. Random sampling is simple and unbiased, while stratified sampling ensures fair representation of different groups. Depending on the situation, one can choose the method that gives the most reliable results.\n"
