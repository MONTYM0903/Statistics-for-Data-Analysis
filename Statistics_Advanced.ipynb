        "A **random variable** is a function that assigns a numerical value to each possible outcome of a random experiment. It turns qualitative chance events (like flipping a coin or measuring rainfall) into numbers so we can use algebra and calculus to study randomness. Saying “random variable” does not mean the number itself is always random after an outcome — once the outcome happens the variable has a fixed number. The randomness is in the mapping from unknown outcomes to numbers.\n",

        "Answer:\n",
        "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is one of the most important principles in probability and statistics. Informally, it states that the distribution of the sample mean (or sum) of a large number of independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables tends toward a normal distribution, regardless of the original variable’s distribution, provided the original variables have finite mean and variance.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Normality from non-normal data**\n",
        "You can take many kinds of data — skewed, discrete, or otherwise irregular — and the average of large random samples will be approximately normal. This is why normal-based inferential techniques (z-tests, confidence intervals) are widely useful even when the population is not normal.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Foundation for inference**\n",
        "The CLT gives a theoretical justification for: using standard errors SE=s/n,constructing confidence intervals for means, performing hypothesis tests about population means, and approximating binomial/proportion distributions by normal when np and n(1−p) are large.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Simplifies complex problems**\n",
        "Many complicated sums or aggregates (total demand, average rating, total claims) behave nicely due to CLT, allowing simple normal-based approximations rather than bespoke distribution derivations.\n",
        "\n",

        "A confidence interval (CI) quantifies the uncertainty of an estimate by providing a range of plausible values for a population parameter (like a mean or proportion).

Importantly, for the single interval you compute, it is incorrect (from a strict frequentist view) to say there is a 95% probability the true parameter lies within it; the interval either contains θ or it doesn’t.
